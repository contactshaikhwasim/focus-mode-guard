# Focus Mode Guard â€“ Multi-Select with Dynamic Override

## Description

This Visual Studio Code extension enforces a focus mode where users can only open pre-selected files or folders. Attempting to open restricted files or folders requires user confirmation by typing the filename or folder name. If another valid file or folder is typed, it is added to the focus list automatically.

The extension follows SRE principles (reliability, observability, resilience, failure isolation) and software design patterns (Singleton, Observer, Command, Strategy).

## Features

- Enable/Disable Focus Mode
- Manage focus list with multiple entries
- Restrict file opening with modal confirmation
